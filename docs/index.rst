.. _swh-scheduler:

Software Heritage - Job scheduler
=================================

Task manager for asynchronous/delayed tasks, used for both recurrent (e.g.,
listing a forge, loading new stuff from a Git repository) and one-off
activities (e.g., loading a specific version of a source package).


Description
-----------

This module provides two independent scheduler services for the Software
Heritage platform.

The first one is a generic asynchronous task management system allowing to
define tasks with a small number of scheduling properties. In this
documentation, we will call these swh-tasks to prevent confusion. These
swh-tasks are stored in the scheduler database, and a HTTP-based RPC service is
provided to create or find existing swh-task declarations, or select swh-tasks
ready for immediate scheduling.

The second one is specific to the scheduling of origin visits (i.e. loading
tasks). These visits used to be managed by the generic task system presented
above, but this later proved to be less and less suitable to handle the billions
of recurring tasks the origin visits require.

The execution model for all the tasks (generic swh-tasks as well as origin
visits) is using Celery. Thus, each swh-task type defined in the database must
have a (series of) celery worker capable of executing such a swh-task, as well
as there must exist celery workers for origin visits.

As mentioned above, in addition to the original and generic task management
system, ``swh-scheduler`` is now also responsible for keeping track of forge
listing and origin loading statistics. These statistics are used to organize
the scheduling of future loading tasks according to configurable scheduling
policies.

For each of these 2 scheduling management systems, several services are
provided to orchestrate the scheduling of these swh-tasks as Celery tasks on
the one hand, and origin visits as Celery tasks on the other hand.

Generic task scheduler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The generic task scheduler consists in a database and its access API, along
with a couple of services.

First, the ``scheduler-runner`` service is a daemon that regularly looks for
swh-tasks in the database that should be scheduled. For each of the selected
swh-task, a Celery task is instantiated.

There is also a ``scheduler-runner-priority`` service running; this
is a ``scheduler-runner`` dedicated to schedule tasks with high priority (e.g.
tasks resulting from the ``save code now`` feature).

Second, the ``scheduler-listener`` service is a daemon that listen to the
Celery event bus to maintain scheduled swh-tasks workflow status in the
database.

Origin visits scheduler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The scheduler system dedicated to origin visits also consists in a database (it
is actually the same database as the generic task scheduler one, but using
dedicated tables) and its access API.

The ``scheduler-schedule-recurrent`` service is a daemon for choosing which
origins are to be visited according to scheduling policies and visit
statistics. It serves the same purpose as the ``scheduler-runner`` from the
generic task scheduler, but it uses different data model and scheduling
algorithms.

Last, there is a ``scheduler-journal-client`` service which listen to the Kafka
journal of the Storage to maintain the loading tasks status and statistics.
Once again, the purpose is roughly similar to the ``scheduler-listener`` from
the generic task scheduler, using Kafka instead of the Celery bus as feedback
loop.


Generic SWH Task Model
----------------------

Each swh-task-type is the declaration of a type of swh-task. Each swh-task-type
have the following fields:

- ``type``: Name of the swh-task type; can be anything but must be unique,
- ``description``: Human-readable task description
- ``backend_name``: Name of the task in the job-running backend,
- ``default_interval``: Default interval for newly scheduled tasks,
- ``min_interval``: Minimum interval between two runs of a task,
- ``max_interval``: Maximum interval between two runs of a task,
- ``backoff_factor``: Adjustment factor for the backoff between two task runs,
- ``max_queue_length``: Maximum length of the queue for this type of tasks,
- ``num_retries``: Default number of retries on transient failures,
- ``retry_delay``: Retry delay for the task,

Existing swh-task-types can be listed using the ``swh scheduler`` command line
tool::

  $ swh scheduler task-type list
  Known task types:
  check-deposit:
    Pre-checking deposit step before loading into swh archive
  index-fossology-license:
    Fossology license indexer task
  load-git:
    Update an origin of type git
  load-hg:
    Update an origin of type mercurial

You can see the details of a swh-task-type::

  $ swh scheduler task-type list -v -t load-git
  Known task types:
  load-git: swh.loader.git.tasks.UpdateGitRepository
    Update an origin of type git
    interval: 64 days, 0:00:00 [12:00:00, 64 days, 0:00:00]
    backoff_factor: 2.0
    max_queue_length: 5000
    num_retries: None
    retry_delay: None


An swh-task is an 'instance' of such a swh-task-type, and consists in:

- ``arguments``: Arguments passed to the underlying job scheduler,
- ``next_run``: Next run of this task should be run on or after that time,
- ``current_interval``: Interval between two runs of this task, taking into
                      account the backoff factor,
- ``policy``: Whether the task is "one-shot" or "recurring",
- ``retries_left``: Number of "short delay" retries of the task in case of
                  transient failure,
- ``priority``: Priority of the task,
- ``id``: Internal task identifier,
- ``type``: References task_type table,
- ``status``: Task status ( among "next_run_not_scheduled", "next_run_scheduled",
            "completed", "disabled").

So a swh-task consist basically in:

- a set of parameters defining how the scheduling of the
  swh-task is handled,
- a set of parameters to specify the retry policy in case of transient failure
  upon execution,
- a set of parameters that defines the job to be done (``bakend_name`` +
  ``arguments``).


You can list pending swh-tasks (tasks that are to be scheduled ASAP)::

  $ swh scheduler task list-pending load-git --limit 2
  Found 1 load-git tasks

  Task 9052257
    Next run: 15 days ago (2019-06-25 10:35:10+00:00)
    Interval: 2 days, 0:00:00
    Type: load-git
    Policy: recurring
    Args:

    Keyword args:


Looking for existing swh-task can be done via the command line tool::

  $ swh scheduler task list -t load-hg --limit 2
  Found 2 tasks

  Task 168802702

Writing a new worker for a new swh-task-type
--------------------------------------------

When you want to add a new swh-task-type, you need a celery worker backend
capable of executing this new task-type instances.

Celery workers for swh-scheduler based tasks should be started using the Celery
app in ``swh.scheduler.celery_config``. This later, among other things, provides
a loading mechanism for task types based on pkg_resources declared plugins under
the ``[swh.workers]`` entry point.

TODO: add a fully working example of a dumb task.
