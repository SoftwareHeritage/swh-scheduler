Description: swh-scheduler
        =============
        
        Job scheduler for the Software Heritage project.
        
        Task manager for asynchronous/delayed tasks, used for both recurrent (e.g.,
        listing a forge, loading new stuff from a Git repository) and one-off
        activities (e.g., loading a specific version of a source package).

        ## Running test manually
        
        ### Test data
        
        To be able to run (unit) tests, you need to have the
        [[https://forge.softwareheritage.org/source/swh-storage-testdata.git|swh-storage-testdata]]
        in the parent directory. If you have set your environment following the
        [[ https://docs.softwareheritage.org/devel/getting-started.html#getting-started|Getting started]]
        document everything should be set up just fine.
        
        Otherwise:
        
        ```
        ~/.../swh-scheduler$ git clone https://forge.softwareheritage.org/source/swh-storage-testdata.git ../swh-storage-testdata
        ```
        
        ### Required services
        
        Unit tests that require a running celery broker uses an in memory broker/result
        backend by default, but you can choose to use a true broker by setting
        `CELERY_BROKER_URL` and `CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND` environment variables up.
        
        For example:
        
        ```
        $ CELERY_BROKER_URL=amqp://localhost pifpaf run postgresql nosetests

        OK
